# ATON 2.0 framework (DEPRECATED)


The ATON 2.0 framework (now deprecated) - developed by B. Fanini (CNR ISPC, ex ITABC) - allows to create scalable and *cross-device* 3D WebApps (mobile, desktop and immersive VR) exploiting modern web standards, without any installation required for the final user.
